# XRP-shitposters-on-X

## Purpose

The purpose of this list is to identify Twitter accounts that frequently share or repost misinformation, outdated content, and/or clickbait about XRP or the XRPL. This list also includes bloggers who present themselves as journalists when there's enough evidence of them spreading this misinformation.

**Engagement Farming**: A practice where content is shared to encourage interaction (comments, likes, reposts) that in turn generates income or followers. This has become particularly prevalent within the XRP/XRPL community with platforms that pay for engagements.

**Note**: This list isn't exhaustive. It's a personal tool for keeping track of accounts to block. If you're on this list and wish to be removed, please correct the misinformation and contact the list owner. Feel free to use and share this list to promote genuine information within the community.

Also, see my compiled list of X accounts who set out to keep you informed with current and relevant information. https://github.com/perldude69/XRPL-XRP-Informers
